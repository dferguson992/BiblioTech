I wrote this as part of an orientation to C# when I started my job at Motorola Solutions.
As of this writing, the code is about 20 months old.  I haven't looked at in awhile, and it
did not benefit from the wealth of experience I gathered at Motorola.  I am too scared to 
open it, lest I find embarrasing code.
